# This file shows a Kubernetes Pod configuration that requests and limits memory resources.
# It is used to demonstrate how to set memory requests and limits for a container. 
# The configuration includes a command to stress the memory usage of the container.
# It is important to ensure that the memory requests and limits are set appropriately to avoid resource contention in the cluster.
# Status will be pending due to the memory request exceeding node capacity.
# The memory requested is more than the available memory on the node, which will prevent the pod from being scheduled.
